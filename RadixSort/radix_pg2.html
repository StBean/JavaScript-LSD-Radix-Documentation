    		<p>Now everything we need is in place and ready execute. This is where things become interesting and 
                may be difficult to understand to those fairly new to distribution type sorts. For that reason I 
                will go through each line of code step by step, doing my best to explain exactly what is happening. 
                It can get quite confusing in the mapping stages, so I will show a reduced version of code 
                in the T-Charts provided.
            </p>
    		<p>With that said, let's move on to first of 2 blocks of code of the radix sort. In the code below is the 
                first block of code which is broken down to 4 for loops, the last containing a nested while loop. 
                This block of code implements the enqueue and dequeue operations for the first sweep and is basically 
                the blueprint for the complete LSD Radix Sort code aside from some minor differences which we will soon see. 
                The first sweep is based on the least significant digit - the one's digit. First take a look at lines 31 and 32 
                in the code below for a moment and try to visualize what is happening and after I will step through each loop of code 
                to show in detail the enqueue, mapping and dequeue processes.

			<p>In lines 30 - 32 of the code above, a for loop is initialized thats sets i = 0 and increments to 9. The first line in 
                the loop is very important. This is where the mapping and enqueue process from the unsorted data array of integers 
                based on the one's digit occurs. The algorithm is located on line 31. Lets assign<i>
                <span style ="color:blue">var</span></i>&nbsp;unsorted to an array of 15 unsorted integers, with values within 
                the range of 0 - 99. This will be the data parameter passed into the radix function. We will go through each 
                iteration below to see what is happening in lines 29 - 31 of the code. Listed in the table below are the 
                15 iterations (data.length = 15). I have included a reduced code in the 3rd column so it is clear which queue, noted
                by it's bin index value, the integers contained in the data array are being mapped and enqueued to.
            </p> 
			<p>It is important to note how the mapping is implemented. The <span style="color:red">%</span><span style="color:blue">10</span>
            &nbsp;operand applied to each integer(data[i]) will result in a value from 0 to 9. So for example, in the first iteration, 
            data[0]<span style="color:red">%</span><span style="color:blue">10</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue">14</span><span style="color:red">%</span><span style="color:blue">10</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue">4</span>. This is the basis of enqueueing based on the 
            one's digit. Also note that the integers will be sorted in place, that is the function will perform it's operations on the original 
            input parameter being passed(data) and return the same data array with it's integer elements over-written and sorted. This 
            eliminates the need to create a new array for storing and returning the sorted result. Below in Table 1 are the results for the 
            15 iterations in the enqueue process.The unsorted array is listed above the table for reference.

            The reduced code<br/>column shows clearly the mapping of each data value to queue location(bin index).</i>
            </p>
			<p>Lets look at the bin array now after the for loop operation. This is shown below. Notice the relationship 
            between the bin index and the one's digit of the integers stored within that queues dataStore array. Also notice the 
            order in which the integers were enqueued. It helps to clarify the process by looking at the original unsorted 
            (data) array, the T-chart in Table 1 and the resultant dataStore arrays located in the queues(bin[0] - bin[9]) of the bin
            array below.
