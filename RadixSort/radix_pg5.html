            <p>In the preceding sections we accomplished sorting our data array by the one's digit which 
                is shown below in figure 1b-1 along with our radix function for reference as we continue 
                with the next block of code which begins at line 44. This will be the second of two blocks 
                as mentioned in the beginning of the article.
            </p>
            <p>Before we move on, I will briefly summarize what we have done up to this point. We first
                passed in an unsorted array of 15 integers ranging in value from 0 - 99 as the data parameter. 
                We then created 10 instances of the Queue class within the bin array. Next we performed a forward
                sweep to enqueue the integers based on their one's digit from the data array into the queues
                within the bin array. The next step was to populate our digIndex array with the values corresponding
                to the number of integers stored within each queue(dataStore.length) and then performed an algorithm 
                on that array which was then used as a mapping array(digIndex). With our digIndex array for mapping, we then 
                dequeued the integers out of the queues within the bin array, starting from the last queue and ending 
                at the first queue. The resultant data array is below:
            </p>
            <p>data = [ 30, 51, 61, 2, 22, 82, 53, 93, 73, 14, 86, 66, 97, 27, 78 ]</p>
            <p>Now it is clear that the integers are indeed sorted based on their one's digit. To complete
                the sort, we need to perform one more sort based on the ten's digit of the current integers in the data
                array and then the process will be complete resulting in a sorted data array.</p>

			<p>On line 44 we start by re-initializing our digIndex array since we will be repeating the process
				similar to lines 30 - 43(Block 1) of the radix function. The differences will be fairly minor. Up to this point
				all the queues within the bin array are empty and ready for enqueueing. In lines 45 - 47 we enqueue the
				integers in our data array based on the ten's digit. As you will notice this time the for loop starts
				at the end of the array as opposed to before, it started from the front of the array. The algorithm for
				enqueueing based on the ten's digit on line 46 is as follows:
			</p>
			<p style="text-indent:25px;">bin[<i><span style="color:purple;">Math</span></i>.<span style="color:purple;">floor</span>(data[i]/<span style="color:blue;">10</span>)<span style="color:red">%</span><span style="color:blue">10</span>].enqueue(data[i])
            </p>

			<p>That may look like a mouth full at first glance but we are simply dividing the data integer by 10, rounding
            down the result using the  <i><span style="color:purple;">Math</span></i>.floor() function, and then like before
            applying the&nbsp;<span style="color:red">%</span><span style="color:blue">10</span> operand to it. The result 
            will be the bin index(queue location) in which we will be enqueueing the data integer to.
			</p>
			<p>As before we will go through all the iterations in the for loop and display them in a T-Chart in Table 1b-1.</p>

                    which maps and enqueues the integers stored<br/>within the data array based on the ten's digit 
                    into the queues within the bin array.</i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The resulting bin array of queues after the operation in Table 3 is shown below in the bin array. Let's 
                take another moment to examine the bin array. As you can see the integers are sorted and stored into the
                queues according to their ten's digit. Now lets take a look at the order in which they were enqueued. If you 
                look at the dataStore array for queues containing more than one integer you will notice their order is from largest 
                to smallest. When we dequeue the integers out we will be starting from the last queue in the bin array and since queue
                data structure behavior is first in - first out, the largest integer will be dequeued out first. Up to this point
                you should be able to mentally picture the dequeuing of integers out of their queues below and notice that it will result 
                in a sorted list.</p>
                <p>Since the next following operation will be identical to the operations done in section A, we will go over them very 
                    briefly without extensive explanation in the remaining part of this section.</p>
