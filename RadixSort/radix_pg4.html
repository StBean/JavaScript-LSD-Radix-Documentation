		<p>data = [ 14, 73, 66, 93, 27, 61, 53, 78, 86, 97, 82, 22, 30, 2, 51 ]

    	</p>
		<p>Our for loop begins with i = bin.length - 1 (i = 9), which will be bin[9], the last queue in the bin array. 
        Notice that the queue is empty and the while loop's condition is "(!bin[i].isEmpty())". The process will evaluate 
        the condition, which is false and therefore not execute the while loop. Now the for loop will decrement i repeating
        the process and dequeueing out the integers if the while loop condition is true up until it has reached the first queue 
        of the bin array. Using a T-chart we can visualize the process with more clarity as seen in Table 2 below. Note in 
        the result mapping column two rows are labeled "no execution", meaning there were no integers stored in that specific 
        queue and the while loop did not execute. Also, please note it is important that the de-increment operator precedes
        digIndex in line 41 of the radix function, data[--digIndex[i]] = bin[i].dequeue().
        </p>

            <p class = "fig"><b><i>Table 2:</i></b><i>&nbsp;T-chart showing the dequeue process in lines 39 - 43 of the radix<br/>

    	</div>
    	<p>The result data array of the first sort based on the one's digit is shown below:</p>
    	<p style="text-indent:25px;">data = [ 30, 51, 61, 2, 22, 82, 53, 93, 73, 14, 86, 66, 97, 27, 78 ]</p>
    	<p>Now that we have our data array sorted by the one's digit, we will need to repeat the process again using the current
    	data array. This time we will be sorting the data array based on the ten's digit and after that process our radix sort will
        be complete. The process will nearly be identical to the process used for sorting by the one's digit with a few exceptions
        which we will see in the proceeding sections. If you have a clear understanding of what we have done up to this point, 
        the proceeding sections should be fairly easy to comprehend.</p>
