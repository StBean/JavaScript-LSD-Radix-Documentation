			<p>Moving on to the next section of the block at lines 33 - 35, we initialize a for loop with i set 
				to 0 and the end condition, i < bin.length (bin.length = 10). We increment by 1 for a total of 10 
				iterations. In the beginning of the radix sort function we initialized an empty array digIndex. 
				Now we will use this array to store the dataStore.length values of each queue. This process is 
				fairly straightforward and and the result is shown below the following code.

for(<i>var</i> i = 0; i < bin.length; i++){
    digIndex.push(bin[i].dataStore.length);
};
</pre>
				</div>

			<p style = "text-indent:105px">digIndex = [ 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0 ]</p>
			<p>Now let's take a moment to go over the array digIndex and what purpose it plays in the radix sort. We will be 
			 	using it in the proceeding sections of our code, which I consider to be the most interesting and clever part 
			 	of the whole code. The array digIndex will be used for mapping the enqueued integers stored within the queues of the
			 	bin array back to their proper location index location in the data array. Since we are sorting in place, the original 
			 	data integers will be overwritten in the process of dequeuing. Before we can use the digIndex array we must 
			 	perform an operation on digIndex that is somewhat similar to the Fibonacci algorithm. This operation is shown 
			 	in lines 36 - 38 of the code below. Basically, it modifies the values in the array starting with 2nd element(the 1st 
			 	index value) of the array. The new value of the 1st index is obtained by summing itself with the previous index's value. 
			 	For example, the value digIndex[1] is 2. So digIndex[1] = digIndex[1] + digIndex[0] which 
			 	would result to digIndex[1] = 2 + 1 = 3. We can write this in shorthand as digIndex[i + 1] += digIndex[i], 
			 	with i = 0 at the beginning of the for loop. The result of this operation is shown below the following code.

			<p style = "text-indent:105px">digIndex = [ 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 10, 12, 14, 15, 15 ]</p>
			<p>Before we go on let's take a moment to look at the current digIndex array. Notice subtracting 1 from 
				the the lowest value in the array will result to 0. Now subtracting 1 from the highest value in the 
				array will result in 14. Remember our original unsorted array we passed in (data) contained 15 integers 
			    (data[0] to data[14]). This may give you some insight for how digIndex plays its role in mapping out the 
			    dequeued integers from the queues in the bin array back into the data array in the proceeding steps of code.
			</p>
			<p>We are now ready to perform the first of two dequeue operations in the next lines of code, 39 - 43. 
				This will require a while loop nested within a for loop. This operation will require our current
				digIndex array for mapping integers from the queues in the bin array to our data array, overwriting the 
				current values. The for loop will start from the last queue of the bin array (bin[bin.length - 1])  
				and dequeue the integers until the queue is empty. The for loop will then de-increment i moving to the
				preceding bin index and repeat the process up until it has reached bin[0], the first queue. When the operation 
				is done all the queues will be empty again.
			</p>
			<p>The nested while loop continues to dequeue until the bin is empty. This is where our function from the 
				Queue class, isEmpty() comes in handy. The while loop's condition is "!bin[i].isEmpty()" so when the 
				queue is empty the condition will equate to false and the while loop will stop. Now pay close attention 
				to the while loop in lines 40 - 42. This is where the dequeuing and mapping from the queues in the bin array 
				to the data array takes place. In the proceeding section we will go through this process in detail so we 
				can clearly see where the integers in the queues are mapped and dequeued to in the data array.
